# Hotel-finder
This is a software engineering project for level 300 at the university of cape coast
This Web application seeks to enable users search hotels, and book them.

# How it works
The Hotel Finder application has a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for hotels
The various hotels are linked to the websites of the hotels where users can book and cancel reservations as well
Users can view the details of each hotel, including room availability and prices, and make a reservation by providing their personal information and payment details.

The Hotel Finder is developed using the agile methodology.
This means that we continuously improve the application by adding new features based on user feedback.
